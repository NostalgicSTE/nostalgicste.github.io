                                    vision in life is to be a conscientious man, to contribute back to the society.

                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Sass, Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, is one
                                            of the multiple CSS pre-processor. It reduces repetition of CSS and
                                            therefore saves time for the developer. I was exposed to SASS back from OOPG
                                            (Object Oriented Programming), where I was intrigued by how it really
                                            brought out the beauty of web development (frontend), making it enjoyable.
                                            Since then, I am fully dedicated to use SASS in my other projects.</p>

                                            fields like artificial intelligence and data science. I started using python
                                            since the age of 11, when I was exploring Linux environment, and wrote
                                            simple automation codes for Wi-Fi exploitation. Since then, I have studied
                                            the essentials of the language and am proficient.

                                            applications such as Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket. I am well-versed with

                                            independent developer's project works. Other than being a hosting platform
                                            for version control, Github also serves as a coding collaboration tool. I am

                                            got this opportunity to explore what it really meant by maintaining servers.
                                            From basic installation to maintaining the uptime of the servers, I am
                                            proficient in the essentials of operating in a server room.</p>

                                            both were intertwined. Since then I have grown to have an indistinguishable
                                            bond over the eco-system of Linux. I really loved its versatility,
                                            motivating me to explore the system in-depth. From basic CLI commands, to
                                            advanced processing, I am able to comfortably work on Linux system with

                                            knowledge of the usage of Hypervisor, a Windows based application that
                                            creates virtual machines like servers. These virtual machines are the
                                            stepping stone for an actual cloud environment. On the contrary, I have used
                                            remote desktop, smaller scale cloud computing connections made to a desktop
                                            from remote location. I will indulge myself into large scale cloud computing
                                            in my near future, in hopes to master its usage.</p>
