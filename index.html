                                initiating the internship.Within the Active Directory software, I learnt how to setup

                                proper establishment of the server. This was a new experience for me, as this was all

                                Server, to the different services’ initiation. Through this portion of work, I got to
                                understand various protocols and services that run on our devices on a
                                split-second, and understood the work

                                mostly automated by the software. The efforts come in during the pre-migration period,
                                where we had to look through every single one of the 80+
                                projects, and the repositories that they contain, and make
                                spreadsheet, containing the different access rights, description of projects, and
                                corresponding users. Additionally, we
                                had to cross check with Active Directory’s user list, to verify if the user was still
                                actively contributing to the
                                company or can be demoted from all project roles. All those above-mentioned activities
                                were to be planned to be done
                                across a span of 3 days, with some project prioritisation, as they were more urgent than
                                the other projects.

                                point into this world, as it went through all from basics such as OSI (Open Systems

                                and social engineering. I would say that this course was one of the key reasons I

                                        exists in ST Engineering, under our department of DFS. This consisted of
                                        projects, scaling up to having multiple
                                        dashboards and workflows preconfigured in the old server. This migration process
                                        is necessary, due to a change in
                                        Atlassian business strategy, where all of the corporations which are using their
                                        Server support feature were to migrate
                                        to either Atlassian’s cloud data center or outsource their own servers, as
                                        Atlassian will discontinue the support for

                            <p>Working in a server room, and maintaining them has always been my dream, since I last saw
                                an engineer's experience video, at Google's data center. The experience I got during my
                                time at Amo Kio site's server room, fulfilled my long time desire. At there, we we
                                involved in various kinds of physical and technical works, from wire works in switches
                                and production servers, to learning indepth of how networking works amongst the servers.

                                    User Retrieval executable file is a PowerShell executable cmdlet, created with the
                                    purpose of retrieving Active Directory
                                    user information and format it into an Excel-based file format. This project has
                                    gone through multiple alteration and
                                    modifications due to unforeseen circumstances, but was also one of the easiest tasks
                                    undertaken at work.

                                    This project initially was not the “User Retrieval Executable”, but was similar to
                                    the above mentioned “Jira Service
                                    Desk” application, referred to as the “User Information Requestable – Jira”. It was
                                    initially planned to be programmed
                                    in Jira, with a similar web interface as the service desk, but instead of multiple
                                    sub menus, it was supposed to serve
                                    one purpose, which is to accept an argument of username, and then return the user
                                    the information requested on the issue
                                    request page itself. However, it was not possible to execute an action of such
                                    complexity in Atlassian server. It was
                                    later changed to the now existing project “User Retrieval Executable”.

                                    we were involved in server configuration operations such as iLO setup, raiding of
                                    hard disks, switch management and not to forget wire works. in a later date, we also
                                    installed ubuntu OS into those servers. This portion of our internship was by far
                                    the most contentful and informative task. From learning about basics of how hard
                                    disks work, to understanding the importance of terminologies used in the networking
                                    field, things learnt during this task would be the most helpful in the future, in

                                    Throughout the course of 22 weeks at this company, I have faced numerous challenges
                                    technically and sometimes socially. If things don't work, ask questions to try to
                                    determine the main cause of the problem; otherwise, find alternative ways
                                    to address the problem or execute the solution. Following the interactions, the
                                    technical portion of work was tough to a certain extent, with a not so surprising
                                    steep learning curve.
